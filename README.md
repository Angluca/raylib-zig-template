# zig-template: raylib + raygui ...
A fairly minimal [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) example codebase using the [zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) package manager.

This example requires one of the recent development releases of zig.

tested with zig version: `0.12.0-dev.2755+07c1dd3d1`

```
All your codebase are belong to us.
Run `zig build test` to run the tests.
--------------------
Here are some hints:
Run `zig build --help` to see all the options
Run `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` for a small release build
Run `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall -Dstrip=true` for a smaller release build, that strips symbols
Run `zig build -Draylib-optimize=ReleaseFast` for a debug build of your application, that uses a fast release of raylib (if you are only debugging your code)
```
